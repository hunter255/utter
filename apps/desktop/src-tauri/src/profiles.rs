//! Maps each [`LanguageProfile`]'s hotkey binding to its own engines,
//! building them lazily on first use rather than at boot.
//!
//! ## Why lazy
//!
//! The models a profile can select together weigh about a gigabyte, the app
//! sits in the tray all day, and most sessions only ever speak one language.
//! Loading every configured profile's engine at boot would make a bilingual
//! setup cost more idle memory than a monolingual one, even for someone who
//! never presses the second hotkey. [`ProfileRegistry`] instead builds a
//! profile's [`ProfileDeps`] the first time [`ProfileRegistry::deps_for`] is
//! asked for its binding, and keeps the result for every call after that.
//!
//! ## Why failure isolation matters here
//!
//! Before profiles there was one engine: if it failed to load, dictation
//! didn't work, and that was the whole story. With more than one profile, a
//! broken model for one language must not take a healthy one down with it.
//! A profile whose model is missing or damaged still resolves to `Some` from
//! [`ProfileRegistry::deps_for`], carrying the same `unavailable_engine`
//! stand-in [`crate::runtime_boot::build_engine`] already falls back to,
//! plus a notice explaining why — never a load that poisons the whole
//! registry or one that silently disables another profile's hotkey. `None`
//! from `deps_for` means only one thing: no binding with that id exists.
//!
//! ## The `_Exit()` trap
//!
//! `runtime_boot::build_sherpa` calls `ModelManager::verify_installed`
//! before ever handing a path to sherpa-onnx: a corrupt model file makes
//! sherpa's C++ layer call `_Exit()`, which takes the whole process down —
//! every profile, healthy ones included, with no chance for Rust to catch
//! it. [`RealProfileLoader`] reuses `runtime_boot::build_engine` (which
//! reuses `build_sherpa`) and `runtime_boot::build_draft_engine` rather than
//! reimplementing engine construction, so that check is never bypassed by a
//! profile-specific load path — for the preview model just as much as for the
//! one whose text gets injected.

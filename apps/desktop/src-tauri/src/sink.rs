//! [`EventSink`] implementation that emits Tauri events to every window and
//! drives the HUD window's visibility from the dictation phase.
//!
//! ## The HUD must never take keyboard focus
//!
//! Injection (paste or direct typing) is synthesized via a virtual keyboard
//! right after a dictation session ends, targeting whatever window
//! currently holds keyboard focus. If the HUD itself holds focus at that
//! moment, the synthesized keystrokes go to the HUD (a borderless overlay
//! with no text field) instead of the app the user was dictating into —
//! the injector still reports success, but nothing visibly happens.
//!
//! `tauri.conf.json`'s hud window sets `"focus": false`, which only
//! controls whether the *window manager* grants it focus at creation time.
//! On Linux/GTK (`tao`'s window backend), that alone is not durable: a
//! window created with `focus: false` but the default `focusable: true`
//! gets its GTK `accept-focus` property temporarily cleared, then a
//! one-shot handler restores it to `true` on the window's *first* GTK
//! `draw` event — which fires the first time the (initially hidden) HUD is
//! actually shown. From that point on the HUD is fully focusable, and
//! GNOME Wayland grants it keyboard focus every time `show()` is called
//! afterward, stealing it from whatever the user was dictating into.
//! Confirmed live: `hud.is_focused()` reads `false` before the very first
//! `show()` and `true` every time after.
//!
//! `tauri.conf.json` also sets `"focusable": false` on the hud window,
//! which is necessary but, measured live on GNOME/Wayland/Mutter, is *not*
//! sufficient by itself: the compositor still grants the window real
//! keyboard focus on `show()` regardless of the GTK-level `accept-focus`
//! property, because that property is an X11/GTK concept Mutter's Wayland
//! `xdg-shell` focus policy for ordinary toplevels does not fully honor.
//! [`configure_hud_window`] additionally sets the window's GTK type hint to
//! `Notification`, which *is* a category Mutter's Wayland focus policy
//! excludes from ever receiving keyboard focus — measured live, this drops
//! the window holding focus at the moment injection fires from 3/3 trials
//! to 1/3 (only the very first `show()` of a freshly started process can
//! still race, matching the "first GTK `draw` event" trigger above; every
//! `show()` after that in the same process is clean).
//!
//! [`TauriEventSink::set_hud_visible`] additionally re-asserts
//! `focusable(false)` via [`tauri::WebviewWindow::set_focusable`] after
//! every `show()` as defense-in-depth, and hides the HUD (rather than
//! showing it) during the `Injecting` phase as well as `Idle`, so it holds
//! as little window state as possible while the synthesized keystrokes go
//! out — injection is effectively instant, so the HUD never visibly
//! renders an "injecting" state anyway.

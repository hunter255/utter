// The HUD pill's vertical geometry, in CSS pixels, in one place.
//
// This lives outside `Hud.svelte` because the numbers have to agree with
// something the stylesheet cannot see: the `hud` window in
// `apps/desktop/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. That window is fixed-size,
// undecorated and transparent, so a pill too tall for it has nowhere to go —
// no scrollbar, no resize, just rows laid out past an edge the compositor
// clips at. `__tests__/layout.test.ts` pins the two together.
//
// `Hud.svelte` feeds every one of these to its stylesheet as a custom
// property (see `HUD_STYLE`), so the arithmetic here is the arithmetic the
// browser performs.

 * undecorated and fixed-size, with no scrollbar and no room to grow, so a
 * pill laid out past this many pixels is clipped at the edge — which is
 * exactly what hid the live preview.

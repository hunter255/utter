// the DOM is perfectly correct and the pixels are gone — so the arithmetic is
// asserted here instead, against the window `tauri.conf.json` asks for and is
// given (see `WINDOW_HEIGHT`).

// reads exactly the ones it is handed, and that nothing pins the pill's
// height behind their backs.

// They are a source check, not a measurement. What they cannot do is lay the
// pill out: none of them would notice a row that overflows for some reason
// nobody wrote down here, and jsdom would not either — it has no layout
// engine, so a rendered-DOM test of this would report every box as zero and
// pass no matter what. Only a real engine measures: driving the built HUD in
// headless Chromium and reading `.hud`'s `getBoundingClientRect().height`
// against `pillHeight()` is the test that would, and it needs
// browser test infrastructure this repo does not have.

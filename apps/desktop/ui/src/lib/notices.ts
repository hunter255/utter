// The `notice` event, collected into a small list the settings window can
// render.
//
// Two channels carry a notice, and neither one alone carries every notice.
// `src-tauri/src/sink.rs` puts them in front of the user as desktop
// notifications, which is the only channel that works during dictation, when
// the window this store feeds is closed — but that channel is rate limited,
// and a notification held back there is dropped rather than deferred. This
// store is the other half: the full wording, still on screen after the
// notification has faded, dismissed only when the user says so, and — via
// `start()`, which drains the backend's parked queue — including the startup
// notices that were reported before any window was loaded to hear them.
//
// Plain store contract rather than runes, for the same reason as
// `stores.ts`: no component lifecycle here, and a `.ts` file is unit-testable
// with no Svelte compilation step.

//! uinput-backed virtual keyboard for synthesizing key events.
//!
//! Events written to a `/dev/uinput` virtual device are delivered to the
//! kernel input stack exactly as though a hardware keyboard produced them.
//! That is what lets this approach work under Wayland compositors (GNOME
//! included), where synthetic input cannot otherwise be injected into an
//! arbitrary focused window.
//!
//! This mechanism is Linux-only; [`VirtualKeyboard`] exists on every
//! platform so callers don't need `cfg` gates, but on non-Linux it is an
//! uninhabited stub whose constructor always fails with
//! [`utter_core::InjectError::NoBackend`].

# Utter

**Utter it. It types.**

Utter is a privacy-first, Linux-first desktop dictation app. Each language
you dictate in gets its own hotkey chord — press it, speak, and clean,
formatted text lands in whatever field currently has focus — a terminal, an
editor, a chat window, anything. Speech recognition runs locally by default
(whisper.cpp or sherpa-onnx); an optional LLM pass cleans up filler words and
punctuation before the text is typed. Nothing about the pipeline is fixed:
each profile's engine, model and refinement tone, and the injection method,
are all swappable in settings.

Audio never touches disk, API keys live in the OS keyring, and the app makes
no network calls except the ones you configure yourself (a refinement
endpoint, a model download).

## Features

- **Language profiles** — bind an independent hotkey chord to each language
  you dictate in, each with its own speech-to-text engine, model, and
  refinement tone; press a profile's hotkey and everything downstream
  follows from it automatically, with no separate engine switch. Engines
  load lazily, the first time a profile's hotkey is actually pressed, and a
  profile whose model is missing or damaged never disables another
  profile's hotkey.
- **Dictation session** — push-to-talk or toggle mode, a small always-on-top
  HUD showing recording/transcribing/refining state and a live input level
  meter, cancel with Escape or a hotkey tap. If a Bluetooth/USB microphone
  disappears, the partial utterance is discarded with an actionable notice;
  a missing explicitly selected input can use the system default for that run
  without silently changing the saved preference.
- **Speech-to-text engines** — `whisper.cpp` for accurate batch transcription
  (tiny through large-v3-turbo, quantized variants included); `sherpa-onnx`
  for fast offline transcription, one transducer model per language
  (GigaAM-v3, Russian only, and Parakeet TDT 110M, English), both emitting
  punctuation and capitalization directly and both accepting personal
  dictionary terms as hotwords; or any OpenAI-compatible cloud
  `/audio/transcriptions` endpoint (BYOK). Every model selector is populated
  from the catalog and shows language fit, relative runtime cost, download
  size, and a warning when a profile language does not match the model. Large
  downloads can be cancelled without leaving a partial model installed; the
  next attempt resumes verified partial bytes, and a stalled connection ends
  with a clear retry instead of waiting forever. If the primary Hugging Face
  endpoint fails, catalogued Hugging Face artifacts can continue through
  `hf-mirror.com`; Utter announces that fallback first and accepts the result
  only when the original expected size and SHA-256 both match.
- **Live preview** — optionally, a second streaming sherpa-onnx model runs
  alongside the engine above and shows words in the HUD while you are still
  speaking. It is a draft only: the text that actually gets inserted always
  comes from the engine above, at the end of the utterance. The preview
  models are small on purpose (27 MB Russian, 43 MB English) and get a single
  inference thread, so they stay out of the way of the model whose output you
  keep — the price is lower accuracy and no punctuation, which is why their
  words never leave the HUD. Off by default, picked per profile, and a
  preview model that is missing, damaged or fails mid-utterance leaves that
  profile's preview dark without touching dictation.
- **AI text refinement** — optional pass over the transcript: removes filler
  words, fixes punctuation and casing, applies a tone preset (`verbatim`,
  `clean`, `formal`, `notes`, `code-comment`). Works against any
  OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` endpoint, including a fully local
  **Ollama** setup. If refinement fails or times out, the raw transcript is
  injected instead of losing the dictation.
- **Personal dictionary** — custom terms hinted to the engine and the
  refiner, plus literal "heard X, write Y" replacement rules applied to every
  transcript.
- **Snippets** — a spoken trigger phrase expands to a stored template,
  bypassing refinement entirely.
- **History** — a local SQLite log of past dictations (text, engine,
  duration, target app) with search and delete; disable it entirely if you
  don't want it. Audio itself is never stored, history setting or not.
- **Text injection** — clipboard-paste (fastest, default), direct typing, or
  clipboard-only as a universal fallback, tried in order until one works.
  Direct typing synthesizes individual key presses and so covers only what a
  US-QWERTY layout can reach; anything else (Cyrillic, CJK, emoji) falls
  through to clipboard-paste rather than being dropped.
- **Tray and settings UI** — a quick refinement on/off toggle, a full
  settings window (profiles, engines, refinement, dictionary, snippets,
  history), and a first-run onboarding flow that walks through mic check,
  model download, hotkey choice, and permissions. The General page's Launch
  at login switch manages the operating system's startup registration and is
  reconciled with the saved preference on every app start.

The HUD floats above whatever window has focus while dictating, showing the
current phase (listening, transcribing, refining, injecting), a live input
level meter, and — for a profile that has a live preview model selected — the
partial transcript as it comes in.

**Profiles** — one chord per language. Each profile carries its own engine,
model, language tag, live preview model and refinement policy, so pressing its
hotkey selects the whole set at once.

## Utter vs. the alternatives

| | **Utter** | Wispr Flow | Handy |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open source | Yes (MIT/Apache-2.0) | No | Yes |
| Linux support | Yes, first-class | No | Yes |
| Local processing | Yes, default | No (cloud-only) | Yes |
| AI text refinement | Yes — tone presets, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint incl. Ollama | Yes (cloud) | Yes |
| Personal dictionary | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Snippets | Yes | No | No |
| Price | Free | Subscription | Free |

Wispr Flow and Handy are both good products; the comparison is here so you
can pick the right tool. Utter's bet is that flexibility — swappable engine,
model, refiner, and injection method — matters more than any single
default choice.

## Install

Prebuilt `.deb` and AppImage packages are on the
[Releases](https://github.com/eluceon/utter/releases) page. They bundle the
sherpa-onnx engine, so the offline models the default profile uses work
without any extra setup.

They are built on Ubuntu 22.04 and need **glibc 2.35 or newer** — Ubuntu
22.04+, Debian 12+, Fedora 37+. On anything older, build from source.

The live preview is off by default and takes two steps to turn on: download a
streaming model under Settings > Engines > Live preview models, then select it
for a profile under Settings > Profiles > Live preview. That order matters —
a profile's engines are rebuilt when settings are saved, not when a download
finishes, so a preview model selected before it was downloaded stays silent
until settings are next saved or the app restarts. A build without the
`sherpa` feature has no preview at all.

### Build from source

System dependencies (Debian/Ubuntu; see the [Tauri prerequisites
guide](https://tauri.app/start/prerequisites/) for other distributions):

```sh
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev libgtk-3-dev libasound2-dev \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev \
  pkg-config build-essential cmake
```

You'll also need Node.js 20+ and a stable Rust toolchain.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/eluceon/utter.git
cd utter

cd apps/desktop/ui && npm ci && cd ../../..

cargo tauri dev     # run in development
cargo tauri build   # produce a release bundle
```

On macOS, use the repository helper for permission-sensitive testing:

```sh
./scripts/build-macos-dev.sh
open target/release/bundle/macos/Utter.app
```

It signs the completed local bundle with a stable development requirement, so
macOS can remember Microphone and Accessibility grants across rebuilds. The
first run after switching from an unsigned build asks once more; later builds
keep the same identity. The default signature is local-only and must not be
distributed. If an Apple Development or self-signed Code Signing identity is
already installed in Keychain, use the stronger form:

```sh
UTTER_DEV_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Certificate Name" ./scripts/build-macos-dev.sh
```

Raw `cargo tauri dev` executables are rebuilt in place without an application
bundle signature, so macOS may treat each changed binary as a new privacy
client. Use the helper above when testing the microphone or text injection.

The permanent bundle and Keychain service identifier is
`io.github.hunter255.utter`. Builds made before that identity used
`dev.utter.app` for macOS privacy grants and `dev.utter.utter` for storage.
On first launch, Utter copies settings and history and moves downloaded models
from `~/Library/Application Support/dev.utter.utter` to
`~/Library/Application Support/io.github.hunter255.utter`; an existing file in
the new directory is never overwritten. API keys are copied from the old
`utter` Keychain service when first read. macOS privacy grants cannot be moved,
so the new identity asks once on its first launch.

If its permission entry is missing or stale, quit Utter, run the matching
command, relaunch, and grant access again:

```sh
/usr/bin/tccutil reset Microphone io.github.hunter255.utter
/usr/bin/tccutil reset Accessibility io.github.hunter255.utter
```

The same commands and shortcuts to the matching System Settings panes are
available in onboarding and Settings > Advanced.

The `sherpa` engine links sherpa-onnx statically; its build script downloads
a prebuilt native archive on first build, so building with `--features
sherpa` (`cargo tauri dev --features sherpa` /
`cargo build -p utter-stt --features sherpa`) needs network access the first
time but no extra linker setup; without it, whisper.cpp and cloud STT still
work out of the box.

## Quick start

On first launch, onboarding walks through a microphone check, downloading a
speech-to-text model, picking a hotkey, and a permissions check.

The default profile's hotkey is `Ctrl+Super`, held to record (push-to-talk);
add a profile per additional language in Settings > Profiles, each with its
own hotkey. Utter reads keyboard events directly from `/dev/input` (evdev)
and synthesizes the paste keystroke through its own virtual keyboard device
(`/dev/uinput`), since Wayland has no standard global-hotkey protocol. Both
require the current user to have access to those device nodes; if onboarding
reports missing permissions, it shows the exact fix:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG input $USER && \
  echo 'KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="input"' | \
  sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/60-utter-uinput.rules && \
  sudo udevadm control --reload-rules && sudo udevadm trigger
# log out and back in for group membership to take effect
```

## Configuration

Settings live in `~/.config/utter/config.toml`, a plain TOML file (XDG
config dir), reloaded automatically when changed through the settings UI. A
missing file just means defaults; unknown keys are ignored rather than
rejected, so the format tolerates being hand-edited or partially upgraded.

- **Profiles** — `[[profiles]]` is a list of language profiles, each with
  its own `hotkey`, `language` tag, `engine` (`whisper`, `sherpa`, or
  `cloud`) and refine tone; the settings UI's Profiles page edits this list.
  There is no single active engine — each profile picks its own. An optional
  `[[profiles]].draft` table with a single `model` key names the streaming
  model that drives that profile's live preview; omitting it, or leaving
  `model` blank, is the default and means no preview.
- **Engines** — models download to `~/.local/share/utter/models` and are
  managed from the Engines page; which engine a profile actually uses is
  chosen on the Profiles page. Four of the catalog's entries are sherpa-onnx
  models, filed under two engine kinds: the offline models whose text is
  inserted (GigaAM-v3 for Russian, Parakeet TDT 110M for English) and the
  streaming models that only drive the live preview (Zipformer Small, one per
  language). There is one model per language in each kind, so a profile's
  engine and preview should both match the language it dictates in. The two
  kinds install under identical filenames, so a model catalogued under the
  wrong kind is rejected on its catalog entry before any of its files are
  opened.
- **Refinement** — point `refine.base_url` / `refine.model` at any
  OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint; the settings UI ships presets for OpenAI,
  Groq, OpenRouter, DeepSeek, and Ollama. For a fully local setup, run
  [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and use its default `http://localhost:11434/v1`
  — no API key required. Cloud providers store their key in the OS keyring,
  never in `config.toml`.
- **Injection** — `advanced.injection` picks the strategy: `auto` (try every
  backend in order), or pin `clipboard_paste`, `type`, or `clipboard_only`.
  `auto` suits most desktops. Clipboard-paste synthesizes Shift+Insert rather
  than Ctrl+V, and publishes the text to both the CLIPBOARD and PRIMARY
  selections, so it works with a non-Latin keyboard layout active and in
  terminals alike.
- **Model memory** — `advanced.model_idle_timeout_secs` controls how long a
  loaded language profile stays in memory after its last completed session.
  The default is 1800 seconds (30 minutes); `0` is the persistent Never
  choice when models should remain resident until settings reload or app
  exit.
- **Dictionary and snippets** — custom terms and replacement rules live
  under `[dictionary]`; snippets are a list of trigger/body pairs under
  `[[snippets]]`. Both are editable from the settings UI.

## Privacy

- Audio is processed in memory only and is never written to disk.
- API keys are stored in the OS keyring (Secret Service on Linux), never in
  the settings file.
- No telemetry, no analytics, no background network calls. The only network
  traffic Utter ever makes is to the STT/refinement endpoint you configure
  and to fetch model files you explicitly download.

## Architecture

Workspace layout, the ports-and-adapters design, the session state machine,
and the key engineering decisions are documented in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md). Contribution guidelines,
including dev setup and test/lint gates, are in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Roadmap

- **v0.3** (this release) — A streaming sherpa-onnx engine driving a live
  partial-transcript preview in the HUD, selected per profile and off by
  default.
- **Later** — Typing into the target application as the user speaks, rather
  than only previewing in the HUD; Windows and macOS runtime adapters; voice
  commands ("new line", "undo that"); translation mode.
